### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

- Yes, I feel that the topics covered in class definitely prepared me for the project. Specifically, learning about Flexbox and the box model was extremely helpful. Flexbox allowed me to create 
a responsive and organized layout across all pages, while understanding the box model helped me manage spacing, padding, and alignment more effectively. These foundational concepts made the 
development process much smoother.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
- If I had more time to work on this project, I would have added more interactivity to the pages. As a user, I really enjoy websites that feel dynamic and engaging, so I would love for my visitors 
to feel that same excitement when exploring my site. Features like hover effects, animated transitions, or interactive elements could enhance the overall experience and make the website feel 
more lively and immersive.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- I feel like my demo went well, especially thanks to my past experience presenting websites, which helped me feel more confident while walking through my project. However, I think I could 
have spoken a bit slower to ensure the audience could follow along more clearly and understand everything I was explaining. One project that really stood out to me was Taliyah’s website—I 
loved how professional and polished it looked. Her use of a hamburger-style dropdown menu was a great touch, and it’s definitely something I’d love to try implementing in a future project.
